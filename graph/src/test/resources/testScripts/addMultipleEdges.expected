added node two to graph
added node three to graph

#Add edges to the graph from one to two, two to three, and three to one with labels
added edge sugar from one to two in graph
added edge spice from two to three in graph
added edge nice from three to one in graph

#Output the list of all nodes in the graph
graph contains: one three two

#Output the list of children for node one, two, and three
the children of one in graph are: two(sugar)
the children of two in graph are: three(spice)
the children of three in graph are: one(nice)
