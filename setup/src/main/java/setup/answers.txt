## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
    Fibonacci failed because originally it should have been testing for negative numbers but instead it was set to
    n <= 0 which included 0 as a case, this was causing it to throw an exception on zero. I removed the "=" so that
    it would only test for negatives.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
    Fibonacci failed this test because it was throwing an exception for 0. This issue was fixed once I resolved
    the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test.


3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
    Fibonacci failed this test because it only needed to return 1 for the cases involving 0 and 1. I fixed
    this by changing the return statement to return 1 instead when n < 2.


## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?
    The value of "x" is 4, "y" is 4, and "sum" is zero when we enter 5 for our first input and 4 as the second.
    The reason why x was not equal to the first integer entered is because our integer that we input is being multiplied by 2
    and divded by 2 which is causing us to get a different x. To fix this, we just need to remove everything else except
    for "console.nextInt();".


2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)
    All the names and values listed in the "Variables" panel include "x = 3" and "y = 3". While, in the "frames"
    tab list, the text that was highlighted included "return x - y; x: 3   y: 4"


3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?
    All of the names and values listed in the "Variables" panel before the steps included, "x = 3" and "y = 4". Then, after
    the first step over "args = {String[0]@714} []" is added. Finally, after the second step over, 
    "console = {Scanner@715} java.util.Scanner[delimiters=\p{javaWhitespace}+][position=3][match valid=true][need input=false][source closed=false] [skipped=false][group separator=\x{2c}][decimal separator=\x{2e}][positive prefix=][negative prefix=\Q-\E][positive suffix=][negative suffix=][NaN string=\QNaN\E][infinity string=\Q∞\E]" is added.
