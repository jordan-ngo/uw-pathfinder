## CSE 331 hw-graph Coding Questions

## Part 2

Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

I included operations of adding and removing edge/nodes, getNode, so that it could return all nodes
in the graph and getChildren. Of which, would return all the children nodes with the getters for the basic
information like the size of the graph or whether or not it was empty and why it would allow basic operations
to be performed. This would also allow for more flexibility on the ADT later. I also included the Node class
and Edges class to make my code more abstract/readable.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?

The testing strategy I decided on for this assignment was to use test to perform basic operations just
so that I could check if a graph was constructed correctly and if a Node was added correctly. I used
the JUnit tests to assisted the testScripts with tests that could not be accounted for easily.
This allowed me to check if the add and remove methods returned the right boolean. This made it where
I could create as many test cases as possible.
